      <p>Across my posts, projects, and CV, I’ve mentioned the tools and stack I’ve worked with both in previous roles and while building this portfolio.</p>

      <p>To make it easier to see the whole picture, here’s a single snapshot that pulls them together.</p>

      <p>I’ve also color-coded each tool so you can quickly see my experience level:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Green: Extensive hands-on experience</li>
        <li>Orange: Managerial or moderate hands-on experience</li>
        <li>Yellow: New as part of portfolio</li>
      </ul>
