      <h2>Tools & stack</h2>
      <p>Below is a snapshot of the tools and technologies I’ve used across the projects on this site.</p>
      <p>Rather than learning tools in isolation, I’ve focused on applying them in realistic, end-to-end data workflows — from ingestion and transformation, through to modelling, automation, and visualisation. Each of these appears in at least one portfolio project and links back to practical work, not just theory.</p>
