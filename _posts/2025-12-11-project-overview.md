After three weeks of solid work, I’ve just published my Jobs Insights dashboard.
**👉 [View the full project dashboard](https://www.graemeboulton.com/job-insights-project/)**  

The dashboard itself only contains seven pages, but getting there involved much more than the visuals. I built an end-to-end pipeline that pulls raw JSON from the Reed.co.uk API, processes it through Python, Azure Functions, Azure Storage and PostgreSQL, and then models it for analysis in Power BI.

The project page includes more detail on the data source, the overall approach, and how I structured the pipeline. There’s also a link to my GitHub, where all of the code and SQL work is publicly available.

This has been a challenging but really valuable learning experience - especially around Python, API ingestion, ETL patterns, and cloud integration and I’ll continue iterating as I build deeper technical expertise. More improvements and additional features will be coming soon.
