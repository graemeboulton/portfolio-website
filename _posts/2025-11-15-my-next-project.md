Welcome to my next portfolio project. In this post, I’ll walk through another hands-on example of my learning journey as I continue developing my SQL, Python, and data modelling skills.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on strengthening my understanding of end-to-end data workflows. It includes:

- Building a structured dataset  
- Writing custom SQL for exploration and transformation  
- Creating a Power BI (or Fabric) model  
- Producing visuals that help uncover trends and insights  

The goal is to practice the exact type of work expected in modern data roles and build up a portfolio of well-explained, practical examples.

## What This Project Covers

### **1. Data Source**
I started with a clean dataset suitable for analysis — using either a public sample database or one I designed myself. I wanted something that required data cleaning, joining, and shaping before any insights could be extracted.

### **2. SQL Exploration**
I wrote SQL queries to explore the data, identify relationships, and test out assumptions. This included:

- Aggregations  
- Joins  
- Window functions  
- Date and time logic  
- Common Table Expressions  

The objective was to turn raw tables into tidy, analysis-ready outputs.

### **3. Power BI / Fabric Modelling**
Once the data was prepared, I moved into modelling and visualisation:

- Fact + dimension structure  
- Measures using DAX  
- Relationships and cardinality  
- Creating a clean semantic model  
- Designing a simple, effective dashboard  

### **4. Key Insights**
A summary of the insights will be included here once the final report has been published. This section will capture the *so what?* of the analysis.

## What’s Next?

As I progress through my learning plan, I’ll continue publishing projects like this to show real-world applications of SQL, Python, and data modelling. The focus is on:

- Reproducible work  
- Clear explanations  
- Practical use-cases  
- Showcasing improvement over time
