One of the reasons I chose to make my first portfolio project an analysis of the UK data job market was to understand which skills and tools are actually in demand, so I could focus my learning where it matters most.

The results were clear: Azure’s data ecosystem is dominant across UK roles — particularly Data Factory, Databricks, Synapse, and Fabric.

I’ve already had some hands-on experience with Data Factory and Fabric, but Databricks and Synapse are still relatively new to me. So that’s where I’ll be focusing my next stage of upskilling.

My plan is to get properly familiar with both technologies and then decide how best to demonstrate them in a project — either by expanding the job market insights I’ve already built, or by creating something entirely new that showcases those tools in a meaningful way.

If you’re interested in the next stage of this project, I’ll be posting updates as I go.
