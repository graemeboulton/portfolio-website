Over the last couple of weeks I've been working on my portfolio, which starts with providing insights into a sample of the job market, from Reed.co.uk, via their API.

It's been a really fun and challending project as it involved working with the API, using Python to do significant manipulation to the queries and data, a lot of SQL to create various tables and view and then pulling it together in PowerBI and performing further manipulation using PowerQuery and M code.

I'm going to go into a significant amount of detail about how it was all pulled together and I'll shre it here in due course, alongwith links to GitHub and it may (don't hold me to it) include a walk through video.. eek!

In the meantime, you can check out the work by clicking on 'Jobs Project' in the nav.
