# Graeme Boulton — Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source for my personal portfolio website: **[graemeboulton.com](https://www.graemeboulton.com)**.
It showcases my work in **data analytics**, **business intelligence**, and **cloud engineering**, and acts as a central place for my projects, dashboards, and articles.

The site is built using the **Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme**, deployed via **GitHub Pages**, and customised to serve as a clean, fast, and easy-to-navigate portfolio for prospective employers, recruiters, and anyone curious about my work in data.

## 🚀 Purpose of the Website

The site is designed to:

* Present my end-to-end data projects, including ETL pipelines, cloud architecture, data modelling, and Power BI dashboards.
* Highlight my technical strengths across **Python**, **SQL**, **Azure**, **Power BI**, and modern data engineering practices.
* Share write-ups, technical deep-dives, and learning resources.
* Provide a single, professional landing page during my transition further into the data and analytics field.
